# Deep_learning
Deep learning is a type of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) that uses artificial neural networks to process data. Deep learning models can recognize complex patterns in data, such as pictures, text, and sounds. They can be taught to perform classification tasks and produce accurate insights and predictions.
